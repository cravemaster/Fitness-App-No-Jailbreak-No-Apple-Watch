# Fitness-App-No-Jailbreak-No-Apple-Watch
For those who don't like iDownloadBlog. (Shamefully, the original written tutorial was supposed to be handed to iDownloadBlog first: http://www.idownloadblog.com/2015/03/21/how-to-get-apple-watch-activity-app-ios-8-2-no-jailbreak/.)

No jailbreak required, no Apple Watch necessary. Requires iOS 8.2 or higher. If using iOS 8.2 or higher, check out how to enable the hidden Automation button on iOS 8.2 and iOS 9 (iOS 10 has locked this down and needs a jailbreak to unlock) here:

Use iBackupBot to apply.

Put the "com.apple.Fitness.plist" file (from the "System Files" subdirectory) in "System Files/HomeDomain/Library/Preferences", and then put other plist file (also named "com.apple.Fitness.plist") (from the "User App Files" subdirectory) into the "User App Files/com.apple.Fitness/Library/Preferences" subdirectory in your backup.
