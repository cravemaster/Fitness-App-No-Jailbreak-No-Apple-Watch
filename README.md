# Fitness-App-No-Jailbreak-No-Apple-Watch
For those who don't like iDownloadBlog or have lost the Dropbox link that was posted on one of the articles they made. Shamefully, the original written tutorial was handed to iDownloadBlog first: http://www.idownloadblog.com/2015/03/21/how-to-get-apple-watch-activity-app-ios-8-2-no-jailbreak/.

No jailbreak required, no Apple Watch necessary. Requires iOS 8.2 or higher. If using iOS 8.2 or higher, check out how to enable the hidden Automation button on iOS 8.2+ and all the way up to iOS 9 (iOS 10 has locked this down and needs a jailbreak to unlock because it requires an internal install/internal install spoof, which is exactly what InternalSettings10 does for you) here: https://github.com/cravemaster/Hidden-Automation-Button-For-Apple-Watch-App

Use iBackupBot to apply.

**IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO MAKE A BACKUP OF THE ORIGINAL ITUNES BACKUP YOU MADE JUST IN CASE YOU MIGHT ACCIDENTLY (OR PURPOSEFULLY! ;P) RUIN ANY DATA ON IT!**

Put the "com.apple.Fitness.plist" file (from the "System Files" subdirectory) in "System Files/HomeDomain/Library/Preferences", and then put other plist file (also named "com.apple.Fitness.plist") (from the "User App Files" subdirectory) into the "User App Files/com.apple.Fitness/Library/Preferences" subdirectory in your backup. Then use iTunes to restore your modified backup.

If jailbroken, just use InternalSettings10 to get this hack.
