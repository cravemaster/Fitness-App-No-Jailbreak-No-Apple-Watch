Use iBackupBot to apply.

Put the "com.apple.Fitness.plist" file (from the "System Files" subdirectory) in "System Files/HomeDomain/Library/Preferences", and then put other plist file (also named "com.apple.Fitness.plist") (from the "User App Files" subdirectory) into the "User App Files/com.apple.Fitness/Library/Preferences" subdirectory in your backup.
